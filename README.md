# tic-tac-toe

This is a student project I made while learning javascript, as part of the Odin Project
curriculum.
It is a tic tac toe game that can be played by 2 people, as well as by one
person against an AI (you can even pit two AIs against eachother).
The AI, which I wrote from scratch, has 3 difficulties:
1) easy (random moves), 
2) respectable (checks for immediate wins and immediate loses, and plays accordingly), 3) impossible (plays perfectly. Good luck beating this one!)

The game keeps track of score.

BTW: You can change the name of the players! Simply click on the name box.
